Introduction
============
`MD_plotting_toolkit` is a Python package providing useful tools for 
visualizing simulation data obtained from molecular dynamics. The tools 
available in this package are aimed to enable easy one-line command to 
generate publication-quality figures. While the plotting commands are more 
useful for plotting output files generated by PLUMED or GROMACS (in `.xvg` format), 
the file parser in the package is able to parse any files that is readable by 
`numpy.loadtxt` or any files that only use `#` or `@` as the delimiter. 
With entry points set upon the installation of this package, these commands 
can be executed in any directory from the terminal. These commands include 
`plot_xy`, `plot_xyz`, `plot_hist`, `plot_bar`, `plot_violin`, `plot_matrix`, 
and `combine_plots`. Despite different purposes of these tools, except for 
`combine_plots`, they do share some common funtionalities that could be useful. 
Specifically, most of the plotting commands can do the following:

* Convert the units as needed.
* Scale, truncate, and deduplicate the data as needed.
* Provide simple statistics of the input data.

For more information about these commands, please refer to the tutorials.

Installation
============
The package has not been published to PyPI, but can be installed from our
`github repository`_ using the following commands:
::

    git clone https://github.com/wehs7661/MD_plotting_toolkit.git
    cd MD_plotting_toolkit/
    pip install -e .

Note that this package requries a bunch of other Python packages to be installed,
including NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, pymbar, natsort, and argparse.
